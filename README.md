This example contains 2 functions: `Balanced Binary Search Tree` and `Counting Sort`

### Self-Balanced Binary Search Tree

Can insert, find and delete elements

`test_bst` generate `num_of_iterations` (100) datasets of size 20000 - 120000 elements and on 1000 iterations test
speed of insert, find and delete operations.

Test run displays that correlation between amount of items and duration of operations is below linear

![Iterations to duration](./bst_iterations_to_duration.png?raw=true "Iterations to duration")

Complexity on avarage is Î˜(log(n))

### Counting sort algorithm
